# ü§ñ Algorithm-Visualizer

A simple Algorithm Visualizer that I made while studying algoritms that helps visualizing the how the algoritms work.

## ‚ú® Features
- Selecting which type of algorithm to visualize.
- Selecting which algorithm to visualize.
- Adjusting the speed of the algorithm.

## üöÄ How to Run

Follow these steps to get started with the Algorithm-Visualizer app:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Glory42/Algorithm-Visualizer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate** to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd Algorithm-Visualizer
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser:
    - For **macOS**:
      ```bash
      open index.html
      ```
    - For **Windows**:
      ```bash
      start index.html
      ```
    Alternatively, double-click the `index.html` file to launch it.



## üí≠ How it works
1. **Select which type of algorithm to visualize**.
2. **Select which algortihm to visualize**.
3. **Adjust speed**.
4. **Click start**.
5. **Watch the algorithm do the sorting**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the UI.
- **CSS**: Provides styling.
- **JavaScript**: Implements algorithm's functionality, including handling user input and performing sorting algoritms.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Adding more **sorting Algoritms**.
- Adding **Pathfinding Algoritms**.
